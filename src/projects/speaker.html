    <h1>Speaker</h1>
    <p>This was a project I started recently, planning on making a custom amplifier using the LM386 chip.</p>
    <p>Video detailing finished product for now at the bottom</p>
    <p>Here's the current amplifier circuit diagram, for anyone interested <a href="http://afrotechmods.com/">Here's the source</a></p>
    <p>I plan on modifying this design later on, so I can include the knobs on the front and make em work and all that, possibly another time though.</p>

    <p>And here's the speakers inside.</p>
    <p>It had been modified to work with a RPi previously, using Volumio as a base for streaming music to it, over Airplay</p>
    <p>It was slow and required me to use garbage programs to get it working on Windows, and not a chance on Linux.</p>
    <p>I may end up going full Aux only, and bluetooth secondary, but we'll see how that turns out</p>
    <p>More coming soon once I have the parts to finish the amp, then its on to making the speaker</p>
