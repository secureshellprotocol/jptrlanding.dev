    <h1>FM Radio Receiver</h1>

    <p>So from what i've found, an FM Radio Receiver consists of a few key components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An FM Tuner</li>
      <li>Radio Frequency to Intermediate Frequency</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Radio Frequency is picked up in FM Freq. range</li>
          <li>Converted to Intermediate Frequency (required for high freq. compatability)</li>
        </ul>
      <li>IF Filter</li>
      <li>Demodulator</li>
      <li>Amplifier</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Taking a look, i found this schematic online (Linked directly from their host page)</p>

    <p>After watching a video on FM Radio by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_F3J4vyzNk&t">Great Scott! on Youtube</a>, I feel like I've got the hang of this, probably.</p>
    <p>I'm gonna spend some time making sure I know what I'm doing with this stuff.</p>
    <p>I would also like to <b>not</b> rip someone elses design and learn how this works to develop my own!</p>
    <p>After working on & off with this, I've got an FM circuit in the mail off of eBay, gonna look through how that works specifically.</p>
    <p>Ive also looked into <u>phase locked loops</u>, which are a basis in this sorta technology, and is what the left side is (i think)</p>
